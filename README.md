# 📄 PDF RAG Chatbot (Streamlit + FAISS + Gemini)

A **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** chatbot that allows you to upload PDFs once, store their content persistently using **FAISS**, and ask questions anytime.
The chatbot answers **only from the uploaded documents** using Google Gemini.


## 🚀 Features

* Upload PDF files only once
* Persistent document storage using FAISS
* Ask unlimited questions without re-uploading PDFs
* Answers are generated strictly from document content
* Supports asking multiple questions one after another
* Simple and clean Streamlit UI
* Tracks uploaded PDFs internally


## 🧠 How It Works

1. PDF files are uploaded and read
2. Text is split into chunks
3. Chunks are converted into embeddings
4. All embeddings are stored in a single FAISS vector store
5. On every question:

   * Relevant chunks are retrieved
   * Gemini generates an answer using only that context
